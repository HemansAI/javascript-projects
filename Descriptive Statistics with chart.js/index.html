            Descriptive statistics summarizes or describes the characteristics of a
            data set. Descriptive statistics consists of two basic categories of
            measures: measures of central tendency and measures of variability (or
            spread). Measures of central tendency describe the center of a data set.
            Measures of variability or spread describe the dispersion of data within
            the set.
            <br />All descriptive statistics are either measures of central tendency
            or measures of variability, also known as measures of dispersion.

            Measures of central tendency focus on the average or middle values of
            data sets, whereas measures of variability focus on the dispersion of
            data. These two measures use graphs, tables and general discussions to
            help people understand the meaning of the analyzed data.
            <br />
            Measures of central tendency describe the center position of a
            distribution for a data set. A person analyzes the frequency of each
            data point in the distribution and describes it using the mean, median,
            or mode, which measures the most common patterns of the analyzed data
            set.

        <h2>Mean</h2>
        <p>
            The mean represents the average value of the dataset. It can be
            calculated as the sum of all the values in the dataset divided by the
            number of values. In general, it is considered as the arithmetic mean.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Median</h2>
        <p>
            The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending,
            list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average.
            The median is sometimes used as opposed to the mean when there are outliers
            in the sequence that might skew the average of the values.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Mode</h2>
        <p>
            Mode means a value or a number that appears most frequently in a dataset.
            Sometimes we may need to find the value, which is occurring more frequently 
            in the dataset. In such cases, we find the mode for the set of given data.
